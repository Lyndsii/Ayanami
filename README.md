Information about my discord bot, Ayanami.

Using Ayanami
======
1. In order for Ayanami to do anything, you have to invite her to the discord server of your choice (make sure you have the `Manage Server` permission), editing the permissions she requests may prevent some commands from being usable so please refrain from doing so!

2. Her default prefix is `aya.` (e.g, `aya.help`), but you can also use `@Ayanami` as her prefix (`@Ayanami help`)! Ayanami's help command will bring up a list of her commands, but you can also view them *outside* of discord by going [here](./Information/Commands/FullList.md "Commands")
