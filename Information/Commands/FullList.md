# Usage

Ayanami's default (and only) prefixes are `aya.` and `@Ayanami`. Here's an example of how you could use these prefixes:

```
aya.help

(Brings up a list of commands in discord)

@Ayanami help

(Brings up a list of commands in discord)
```
Easy enough, right? Some commands require things called `arguments` (or `args` for short). For example, Ayanami's `addtag` command requires you to also input a title and description within the same message.
```
aya.addtag Title Description Here

(Tag title will be the first arg: `Title`, Tag description will be the rest of the message (excluding the command name and prefix): `Description Here`)
```
Got that? Great! Now you're ready to use Ayanami's commands! Don't worry if you forget, Ayanami will remind you.
