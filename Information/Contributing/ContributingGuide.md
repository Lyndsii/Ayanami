# Explanation

Contributions are an essential part of Ayanami's development. Mainly because she is maintained by only one person (**cough cough** me) and that one person cannot go through every command for spelling errors and is not creative enough to think of cool new features. Contributions can be, well, *anything that isn't illegal or against the rules*! If your contribution is rejected, don't feel hurt! I tend to be fairly picky and can choose certain things depending on my mood, so it's not always your fault.

To contribute, you should firstly go to [here](./ContributeTemplate.md). Create a fork of the project, edit the template to fill out the fields and then create a pull request! It's as easy as that.

# Examples

Some examples that should give you some ideas about what contributions you can make.

* Commands
* Spelling/Grammar errors
* Responses for certain errors (e.g, telling you that you have provided an invalid ID, etc.)
* Making certain things look more neat
... and anything else that I haven't included!

# Rules and Guidelines

1. Anything that will break the Discord ToS is very much *not allowed*.
2. Anything that's illegal is not allowed.
3. Please including as much detail as you think is needed.
4. Be understanding of the fact that I'm not always bothered to check contributions.
